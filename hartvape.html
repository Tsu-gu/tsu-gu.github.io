<p>This is a bit different from my usual articles but I felt like writing it anyways.</p>
<p>Obligatory smoking is bad for you, this is not an endorsement of vaping/smoking/using addictive substances.</p>
<p>I decided to give Hartvape a try as they are an Estonian company and their flavours seemed interesting.</p>

<p>The flavours I ordered are: Peach Ice, Strawberry Cosmo and Safari Tabacco. </p>

<h1 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h1>
<p>Since I got to smell a peach flavour before and didn't hate, I opened that one first. The manual informed me not to drink the vape's liquid and in case I do that or it touches my skin, I should call an emergency number. This thwarted my plans of using this in a drink mixed with Jägermeister.</p>
<h1 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h1>
<p>My first impressions are that the vape is much easier to draw from than the ones I had before. There's almost no force required to start it, you just pull and it doesn't even make a sound.</p>

<p>The back of it is a glossy plastic with a blue LED underneath. Looks very stylish if you ask me. There's no battery indicator but I have never seen it on this type of vapes so that's okay. Just throwing that out there in case you are expecting one.</p>
<h3 id="taste-of-peach-ice">Taste of Peach Ice</h1>
  <p>It's subtle. You can faintly taste the peach but it's not very strong. I don't mind this as my previous experience taught me that making a bad tasting liquid is very easy. Especially if it's a made up flavour like Cotton Candy or something. Overall it feels smooth. No complaints.</p>
  <p>The vapour doesn't feel too hot either. (I like that)</p>
<h3 id="taste-of-strawberry-cosmo">Taste of Strawberry Cosmo</h1>
  <p>Haven't opened it yet</p>
<h3 id="taste-of-safari-tabacco">Taste of Safari Tabacco</h1>
    <p>Haven't opened it yet</p>

<h1 id="nicotine">Nicotine</h1>
<p>These come in 0mg and 20mg variants. I of course ordered the 20mg one and it works as expected. Not much to add here.</p>
<h1 id="store">The store</h1>
<p>I ordered this from a <a href="https://svetnapojov.sk">SvetNapojov</a> and chose DPD as the delivery method. Zero complaints whatsoever. The package was here within 2 days and I got a soda as a gift since the total value of the order exceeded 50 euros.</p>
