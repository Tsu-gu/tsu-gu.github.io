<h1>How to use free linux distributions anywhere</h1>
<h2>What do you mean? Linux is already free</h2>
<p>Not exactly. Your Linux system actually consists GNU and Linux. GNU is the system itself, including all of the apps you use every day. Linux is the kernel, a component that manages your hardware. Unfortunately, the main version of Linux contains a few non-free parts (also knows as not open source), such as wifi drivers. In fact, most wifi cards will not run without these proprietary drivers.

<h2>Okay, but how is this a problem? 99% Free and Open Source is good enough.</h2>
<p>Sure, and you shouldn't feel bad for using the mainline kernel. But why not go 100% when it will not cost you anything extra.<p/>

<h1>The tutorial</h1>
<ol>
<li>Download one of the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html">FSF approved distributions</a>. With all of these you can be sure that you are using only free software. You can also use Debian, which I decided to go with. The only reason the FSF doesn't recommend it is because they are hosting non-free repositories.</li>
<li>Grab your phone and a data usb cable, and plug it into your computer.</li>
<li>Find an option for USB tethering in your settings, and enable it. (Every single android has it in a different place, so I can't help you) If it's grayed out, don't worry. It will appear once you boot up the system. (PS: this has nothing to do with mobile data. Your phone will just relay the wifi signal to your computer)</li>
<li>Flash the distro you have chosen onto a USB, and install it.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. You are now able to use the system as if you were connected via an ethernet cable. It's so simple yet it hasn't occured to me until a while ago.</p> 

<h1>Few tips</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you connect your phone via a cable because you want to transfer files, but your device is not recognized, install mtp-tools and gvfs-backends, then logout and log back in. This should work on all Debian-based distros.</li>
</ul>
