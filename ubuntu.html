    <h1>An unironic Ubuntu recomendation</h1>
    <img src="Ubuntu_files/Ubuntu.png" width="100" height="100">
<p>My GNU/Linux journey started on Mint back in 2021. Since then I have 
tried Fedora, OpenSUSE, Void, MX, Debian, and avoided Ubuntu on purpose.
 Snaps are evil and slow, and Ubuntu is spyware, correct?... </p>
<h2>The good</h2>
<p>During my short usage, I've completely changed my mind and started loving almost everything about it.</p>
<h3>Autocomplete in the terminal</h3>
<p>On all of the other distros I've used, bash would autocomplete 
package names only if I were to remove them. I'm sure this can be 
replicated anywhere else, but it's extremely useful and enabled out of 
the box.</p>

<h3>Actually meaningful GNOME tweaks</h3>   
 <p>"They just install a bunch of extensions." Really? Such as an <b>extension</b> allowing you to pick an accent color?</p>
   <img src="Ubuntu_files/accent.png" width="auto" height="auto">
    <p>This also translates to highlighed text by the way</p>

       <p>Tray icons are included by default as well</p>  
<img src="Ubuntu_files/trayicons.png" width="auto" height="auto">
     
  <h3>Ubuntu Pro</h3>
  <p>Yup, my 22.04 is supported until 2032 now. My drive is very likely 
not going to last that long, but a system with 9 years of support is 
definitely not something to write off as useless. According to their 
website, you will be getting security patches 1 day after the patch is 
available.</p>
  <p>It's there, and it's completely free for up to 5 machines. Enjoy additional security.</p>

 <h2>The elephant in the room</h2>   
 <p>Snapcraft<img src="Ubuntu_files/snapcraft.png" width="auto" height="auto">. According to a lot of people it's a way for Canonical to control the packaging on Linux.</p>
 

 <p>It may be reinventing the wheel, their performance is not much worse
 compared to flatpaks, and they actually have some advantages.</p>
  <h3>Cleaner commands</h3>
  <p>There is no need to type out full package names like with flatpak.</p>
  <img src="Ubuntu_files/snapgimp.png" width="auto" height="auto">
  
  <img src="Ubuntu_files/flatpakgimp.png" width="auto" height="auto">
     
      <h3>Configuration in plain sight</h3>
 <p>With flatpak I would have to search up where the hell is the 
configuration directory. With Snap, it's right in my home directory.</p>
     <img src="Ubuntu_files/snapfolder.png" width="auto" height="auto">
     
     <img src="Ubuntu_files/snapfolder2.png" width="auto" height="auto">
     
     <p>So what we have here is a flatpak-like system with simpler commands and easily accessible config directories.</p>
     
     
     <p>"But proprietary backend" doesn't make a lot of sense as an 
argument, considering flathub admins may distribute different versions 
of the software if they so wish.</p>
     
     
  <h2>Summary</h2>   
    <p>I think this system doesn't deserve the hate it keeps getting, 
especially from people using ubuntu-based distros. Snaps doesn't 
negatively affect you, the default GNOME implementation is well done, 
and you will never have to worry about having to update to a new 
version.</p>

<p>Also, a quick pro-tip before I go. This applies to GNOME in general but I want to put it here regardless.</p>
          <img src="Ubuntu_files/gnome-tip-1.png" width="auto" height="auto">
          <p>When you create a new text file in this folder, it will appear in your right click menu. No need to thank me.</p>
