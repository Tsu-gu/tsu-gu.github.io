<h2 id="tv">TV shows</h2>
	
	<h3>The Owl House</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/toh.jpg">
<p>A story about a human getting stranded in a magical world. I'm not good with descriptions. It's awesome, go watch it if you haven't already.</p>

    <h3>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/fim.jpg">
<p>Yes. It's unironically a banger. Just give it a try. It's reputation of a show for little girls is very much not justtified, and I can guarantee you will have fun while watching it. You can view it for free on <a href="https"//heatshine.gay" target="_blank">https://heatshine.gay</a>.</p>

 <h3>BoJack Horseman</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/bojack.jpg">
<p>Can you imagine feeling sad for a burned out alcoholic who has sabotaged his own life? No? Well, this show will make you.</p>

 <h3>Tuca and Bertie</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/tuca.png">
<p>A spin off of Bojack. Makes full use of the fact that it's animated, and refuses to acknowledge the existence of the laws of physics. Actually that's not right. It acknowledges them, but mocks them to no end.</p>


<h3>Gravity Falls</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/gf.jpg">
<p>A certified hood classic. No introduction needed.</p>

<h3>Amphibia</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/amph.png">
<p>Yet another story about a human getting stranded in another world. The series relies on its humor in the first season, whereas seasons 2 and 3 are basically one continuous story.</p>

<h3>Wander Over Yonder</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/woy.jpeg">
<p>Adventures of Silvia and Wander, travelling through the universe, where every planet is approximately 5cm in size or something. If you want to enjoy a fun little show, this one's for you. If anything, you will like Lord Hater, the least competent but one of the funniest villains I've ever encountered.</p>
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/woy2.jpeg">

<h3>Regular Show</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/rs.jpeg">
<p>The most normal Cartoon Network show.</p>

 <h3>Talespin</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/talespin.jpg">
<p>Pleanes. Lots of planes. And lots of fun. And also the glorious hand drawn animation style from the 90s.</p>

 <h3>Brickleberry</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/bb.jpg">
<p>As stupid as this show is, I laugh everything I watch its episodes.</p>

 <h3>Southpark</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/sp.jpg">
<p>I believe it needs no introduction.</p>


 <h3>Hazbin Hotel</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/hh.jpg">
<p>Ever since I've discovered the pilot episode years ago, I couldn't wait for the release of the full show. And boy did Vivziepop deliver. The spin off series, Helluva Boss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el_PChGfJN8" target="_blank">(free on youtube)</a> is also worth watching, if you don't mind a plot line resembling Swiss cheese.</p>

 <h3>Moog Girl and Devil Dinosaur</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/mg.jpg">
<p>Beautiful animation, banger of a soundtrack, story that makes sense. Even tho I'm not a fan of superheroes, this is amazing.</p>

 <h3>Zootopia</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/zootopia.jpeg">
<p>An all time favourite. Nothing comes close to it.</p>

        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/pr.jpg">
<p>Monsters vs giant robots created by humans to defend themselves</p>

 <h3>Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/ruby.jpg">

<h3>Lego movie</h3>

<p>One of the last 2D Disney movies. A modern adaptation of the Treasure Island.</p>

<h3>Kung Fury</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/kung-fury.jpg">
<p>Hitler comes back in time and our heroes have to stop him. I love this thing so much. David Sandberg managed to make a movie in the style of 80s with a few dollars, and made it extremely entertaining to watch.</p>


<h3>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/cwacom.jpg">

<p></p>
 <h3>Fallout: Equestria - Project Horizons</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="250" src="images/foeph.png">
<p>A long ass book. Literally. Around 2M words. But worth reading, if you have 6 months to spare.</p>

 <h3>Midnight Library</h3> 
        <img height="auto" width="150" src="images/ml.jpg">
<p>Describes how we don't have to feel bad for the choices we've made in the past, as we don't know every variable, and the outcome can easily be the same no matter what.</p>
